### Project's details
This repository is made to showcase the use of [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) my favorite [Styled-Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) and other Javascript best practices.
The above repository is consuming http://ergast.com/mrd/ and contains:
- Clickable list of seasons
- List of racers per selected season
- Only the winner is highlighted (bold underlined)
- All racers can be added to a Favorites list (stored in localStorage)
- Items in Favorites list can be removed
- It's not focused on styling but it is quite responsive
